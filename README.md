# forecast_tracker

Constructed for Professor Brendan Kelly for use the Math Q class at Harvard (Spring 2026).

Automatically generate 6 datasets based on two weather forecasting model (National Weather Service and Open Meteo) in three different cities (Boston, Seattle, and Salt Lake City).

Daily updates include getting the weather forecast for probability of precipitation for the next 16 days for Open Meteo and 7 days for NWS. It also includes the actualy precipitation as a boolean (True=rain, False=no_rain).

This allows students in Math Q, which is a mathematical modeling class, to understand the probabilistic nature of events such as precipitation and also allows them to compare these two models in order to make real world decisions about policy.

If you would like to download the data, please go to the folder of the data that you want to download, copy the link, and paste it into the bar at this website: https://download-directory.github.io/

Otherwise you can also clone the repo and pull the data on a daily basis to get the most updated files!
